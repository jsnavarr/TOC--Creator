# TOC--Creator

**TOC--Creator** is a tool which can be used in knowledge/articles/content databases to create a table of content based on < H > HTML tags hierarchy, i.e., < H2 > tags are subcontent inside < H1 > tags, < H3 > tags are subcontent of < H2 > tags, and so on.

**TOC--Creator** takes as input an HTML file stored in a database, it adds its TOC and the output will also be stored in a database.


## User Stories

As a user I want to be able to read an HTML file without TOC from the database and add to a different database a new HTML file with TOC.

As a user I want to be able to apply different pre-defined styles to the TOC that **TOC--Creator** made.

As a user I want to be able to see my files in the database.

As a user I want to be able to search by date/keywords in the database.

As an admin I want to be able to see files created by any user.

As an admin I want to be able to delete any file in the database.
